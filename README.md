# Backend Projects and Assignments

This repository is dedicated to my backend projects and assignments. Here, I explore various topics in backend development including RESTful APIs, Node.js, Express, and more. Each project serves as a learning opportunity to apply best practices in server-side programming, data management, and application design.

## Projects
- **To-Do List App:** A simple application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS.

Feel free to explore and review my code as I continue to expand my knowledge in backend development.
